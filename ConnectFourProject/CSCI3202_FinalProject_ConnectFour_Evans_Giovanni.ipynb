    "You have two options for completing your final project for this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1 ####\n",
    "The first option is presented in this notebook and involves implementing a Connect Four game with AB pruning and A* as player strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2 ####\n",
    "The second option is to design your own project that includes any of the algorithms we've discussed throughout the semester, or an algorithm that you're interested in learning that we haven't discussed in class. Your project also needs to include some kind of analysis of how it performed on a specific problem. If you're interested in the design your own project option, you need to discuss your idea with one of the course instructors to get approval. If you do a project without getting approval, you will receive a 0 regardless of the quality of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose EITHER the given problem to submit OR choose your own project topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you choose your own project topic, please adhere to the following guidelines:\n",
    "- Send an email to the course instructors before Friday, November 18 at 6pm, with a paragraph description of your project. We will respond within 24 hours with feedback.\n",
    "- The project can include an algorithm we've discussed throughout the semester or an algorithm that you're been curious to learn. Please don't recycle a project that you did in another class. \n",
    "- If you do your own project without prior approval, you will receive a 0 for this project.\n",
    "- Your project code, explanation, and results must all be contained in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. All work, code and analysis must be **your own**.\n",
    "4. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbook, in-class notebooks and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions, like the form of a probability distribution function, or how to perform a particular operation in Python. You may not use entire segments of code as solutions to any part of this project, e.g. if you find a Python implementation of policy iteration online, you can't use it.\n",
    "5. You may **not** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "6. **You may not collaborate with classmates or anyone else.**\n",
    "7. This is meant to be like a coding portion of an exam. So, we will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "8. If you have a question, post it first as a **private** Piazza message. If we decide that it is appropriate for the entire class, then we will make it a public post (and anonymous).\n",
    "9. If any part of the given project or your personal project is left open-ended, it is because we intend for you to code it up however you want. Our primary concern is with the plots/analysis that your code produces. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",

You need to fill in this class structure for Connect Four using what we did during class as a guide, and then implement min-max search with AB pruning, and A* search with at least one heuristic function. The class structure includes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `moves` is a list of columns to represent which moves are available. Recall that we are using matrix notation for this, where the upper-left corner of the board, for example, is represented at (1,1).\n",
    "* `result(self, move, state)` returns a ***hypothetical*** resulting `State` object if `move` is made when the game is in the current `state`. Note that when a 'move' is made, the column must have an open slot and the piece must drop to the lowest row. \n",
    "* `compute_utility(self, move, state)` calculates the utility of `state` that would result if `move` is made when the game is in the current `state`. This is where you want to check to see if anyone has gotten `nwin` in a row\n",
    "* `game_over(self, state)` returns `True` if the game in the given `state` has reached a terminal state, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "* `utility(self, state, player)` returns the utility of the current state if the player is Red and $-1 \\cdot$ utility if the player is Black.\n",
    "* `display(self)` is a method to display the current game `state`. You get it for free because this would be super frustrating without it.\n",
    "* `play_game(self, player1, player2)` returns an integer that is the utility of the outcome of the game (+1 if Red wins, 0 if draw, -1 if Black wins). `player1` and `player2` are functional arguments that we will deal with in parts **1b** and **1d**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes:\n",
    "* Assume Red always goes first.\n",
    "* Do **not** hard-code for 6x7 boards.\n",
    "* You may add attributes and methods to these classes as needed for this problem."

However when the board is set to a 10x10 with a win condition of 6, the player who goes first wins about the same amount of times as the player who goes second, both having a win percentage of around 44%. Additionally, the number of ties shoots up to around 12% of the time. The win percentage going down substantually when the board is expanded to 10x10 and the win condition changed to 6 makes sense because the state apces got much larger and thus there are far more moves each player can make to win the game. When the board was 6x7, the player who went first won 55% of the time because the limited state space gave an advantage to the first player. Additionally, there are far more ways to win in the 10x10 baord in compairson to the 4x4 board. In the 4x4 board, the win condition divided by the number of columns times the number of rows is 4/16 = 1/4. In the 10x10 board, the win condition divided by the number of columns times the number of rows is 6/100. \n",

Since the A* places a heavy incentive on moves that create a \"7\", the A* player is able to gain an upper hand on the alpha beta player due to the fact that it is not aware of this strategy.

With a larger board the random player would most likely lose in a far less amount of turns than the regular alpha beta player as there are many more random moves that would not be beneficial to the random player. The regular alpha beta player however would give the A* player a run for its money on a larger board and would most likely take many more turns to eventually lose. \n",

    "Although this heuristics seemed to work very well on 3x3 and 3x4 boards with win conditions of 3, I would love to implement a heuristic that also implements pruning since it is impossible to test this A* player on large boards without a super computer. I believe that with the same heuristic on a larger scale, the A* player would be unbeatable and untie-able against random players and regualar alpha beta players. However, on the other hand, I do believe it is necessary to explore every nodes and avoid cut offs to have the most successful heuristic function for Connect Four. \n"
